# Preamble


It is beer to have 100 functions operate on one datastructure than
to have 10 functions operate on 10 data structures.

The goal is is that students who complete this subject should have agood
feel for the elements of style and the aesthetics of programming.

We control complexity by building abstractions that hide detailswhen
appropriate. We control complexity by establishing conventionalinterfaces
that enable us to construct systems by combining standard,well-understood
pieces in a “mix and match” way. We control complexity
by establishing new languages for describing a design, each of
whichemphasizes particular aspects of the design and deemphasizes others


Mathematics provides a frameworkfor dealing precisely with notions of
"what is." Computation provides aframework for dealing precisely
with notions of "how to.".


THe choice for the rest of the book is on a Lisp dialect called Scheme.
Soma advantages of Lisp include:
- that it supports (but does not enforce) more of the large-scale
strategies for modular decomposition of programs than any other language we
know;
- We can make procedural and data abstractions
- we can use higher-order functions to capture common patterns of usage,
- we can model local state using assignment and data mutation
- we can link parts of a program with
streams and delayed evaluation, and we caneasily implement embedded
languages.
